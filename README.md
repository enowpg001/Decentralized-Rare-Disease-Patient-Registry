# Decentralized Rare Disease Patient Registry

A blockchain-based platform empowering patients with rare diseases to securely manage their health data, track symptoms, monitor treatment effectiveness, and connect with relevant clinical trials.

## Overview

This decentralized registry leverages blockchain technology to create a patient-controlled ecosystem for rare disease management. By distributing data across a secure network rather than centralizing it in traditional databases, this system offers:

- **Patient Ownership**: Individuals maintain full control over their health data
- **Data Security**: Cryptographic protections prevent unauthorized access
- **Immutable Records**: Medical history cannot be altered, ensuring data integrity
- **Research Advancement**: Anonymized data aggregation accelerates rare disease research
- **Trial Matching**: Direct connections between patients and relevant clinical trials

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. Patient Registration Contract

The foundation of the registry, securely storing anonymized patient profiles.

**Features:**
- Secure patient identity verification
- Demographic information storage
- Diagnostic confirmation
- Privacy-preserving data management
- Consent management system

### 2. Symptom Tracking Contract

Monitors and records disease progression and manifestations over time.

**Features:**
- Customizable symptom tracking templates per disease
- Severity assessment tools
- Longitudinal data visualization
- Quality of life impact measurements
- Pattern recognition for symptom clusters

### 3. Treatment Response Contract

Evaluates intervention effectiveness and manages medication data.

**Features:**
- Treatment protocol documentation
- Outcome measurement tools
- Side effect reporting
- Dosage adjustment tracking
- Comparative effectiveness analysis

### 4. Research Matching Contract

Connects eligible patients with appropriate clinical trials and research opportunities.

**Features:**
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria matching
- Anonymized data sharing preferences
- Researcher communication channel
- Study enrollment tracking
- Results notification system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
- Web3 browser extension or compatible mobile app
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/rare-disease-registry.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd rare-disease-registry
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Deploy smart contracts to your chosen blockchain network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network_name]
   ```

5. Launch the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Security Considerations

- All patient data is encrypted before being stored on the blockchain
- Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without exposing sensitive information
- Multi-signature requirements for critical data changes
- Regular security audits of smart contracts
- Compliance with relevant health data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)

## Data Privacy

This registry implements "privacy by design" principles:
- Patients explicitly consent to specific data usage
- Data is anonymized using advanced techniques
- Patients can revoke access to their data at any time
- Granular permission settings for different data types
- No central authority with access to all patient information
